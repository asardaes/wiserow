Title: Multi-Threaded, Coercion-Free Implementations of Common Row-Wise Operations
Description: Fast row-oriented operations implemented in C++, all of which are multi-threaded by
    leveraging 'RcppParallel' and 'RcppThread'. Thanks to Boost's 'string_ref', virtually no deep
    copies of input data are made. In contrast to other functions, the ones in this package support
    data frames with differently typed columns as input without coercion to a matrix, performing
    on-the-fly type promotion following R rules, where necessary.
