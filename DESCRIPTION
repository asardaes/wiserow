Title: Multi-Threaded, Coercion-Free Implementations of Common Row-Wise Operations
Description: Fast row-oriented operations implemented in C++, all of which are multi-threaded by
    leveraging 'RcppParallel' and 'RcppThread'. Virtually no deep copies of input data are made,
    even of character data thanks to the 'string_ref' class from the C++ 'Boost' library. In
    contrast to other functions, the ones in this package support data frames with differently typed
    columns as input without coercing to a matrix, performing, if necessary, on-the-fly type
    promotion according to R rules (like transforming logicals to integers to allow summation).
